@article{audibert2009,
	Abstract = {Algorithms based on upper confidence bounds for balancing exploration and exploitation are gaining popularity since they are easy to implement, efficient and effective. This paper considers a variant of the basic algorithm for the stochastic, multi-armed bandit problem that takes into account the empirical variance of the different arms. In earlier experimental works, such algorithms were found to outperform the competing algorithms. We provide the first analysis of the expected regret for such algorithms. As expected, our results show that the algorithm that uses the variance estimates has a major advantage over its alternatives that do not use such estimates provided that the variances of the payoffs of the suboptimal arms are low. We also prove that the regret concentrates only at a polynomial rate. This holds for all the upper confidence bound based algorithms and for all bandit problems except those special ones where with probability one the payoff obtained by pulling the optimal arm is larger than the expected payoff for the second best arm. Hence, although upper confidence bound bandit algorithms achieve logarithmic expected regret rates, they might not be suitable for a risk-averse decision maker. We illustrate some of the results by computer simulations.},

	Abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of asymptotic results available for parametric estimators in dynamic models. Three cases are treated: stationary (or essentially stationary) weakly dependent data, weakly dependent data containing deterministic trends, and nonergodic data (or data with stochastic trends). Estimation of asymptotic covariance matrices and computation of the major test statistics are covered. Examples include multivariate least squares estimation of a dynamic conditional mean, quasi-maximum likelihood estimation of a jointly parameterized conditional mean and conditional variance, and generalized method of moments estimation of orthogonality conditions. Some results for linear models with integrated variables are provided, as are some abstract limiting distribution results for nonlinear models with trending data.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the rate of convergence of the estimation error in regularized least-squares regression when the data is exponentially beta-mixing. The results are proven under the assumption that the metric entropy of the balls in the chosen function space grows at most polynomially. In order to prove our main result, we also derive a relative deviation concentration inequality for beta-mixing processes, which might be of independent interest.  The other major techniques that we use are the independent-blocks technique and the peeling device.  An interesting aspect of our analysis is that in order to obtain fast rates we have to make the block sizes dependent on the layer of peeling. With this approach, up to a logarithmic factor, we recover the optimal minimax rates available for the i.i.d. case. In particular, our rate asymptotically matches  the optimal rate of convergence when the regression function belongs to a Sobolev space.},
